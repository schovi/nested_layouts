NestedLayouts
===============

Introduction goes here.

This allow you to render action, partial, template within more than one layout.

IMPORTANT !
Usually when you write just file name without specific path, it will pick layout from views/layouts folder.
In this plugin it will pick layout from views/controller_name folder.
In future, i will improve "searching" of layouts that will improve back compatibility.
First it will try to find in layouts folder then in controller view folder



Example
=======

class CarsController < ApplicationController

	layout %w{layouts/application cars_layout}, :only => :index

	def index
	# Will render action index within layouts cars/cars_layout and layouts/application
	end
	
	def show
	render :layout => %w{layouts/application cars_layout layouts/big_font_layout}
	# Will render action index within layouts "layouts/big_font_layout", "cars/cars_layout" and "layouts/application"
	end

end

class TruckController < CarsController

	next_layouts "trucks/trucks_layout"
	
	def index
	# This will inherit layouts from CarsController and add "trucks/trucks_layout"
	end

end
